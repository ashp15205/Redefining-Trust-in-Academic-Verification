## Problem Statement
The surge of fake academic certificates threatens trust in
education, employment, and governance. Manual verification
is inefficient, inconsistent, and vulnerable to fraud. A secure,
scalable digital platform is needed to authenticate
credentials against verified records, detect forgery, protect
privacy, and support both legacy documents and digital
certificates.

## Overview
Our goal is to build a secure academic certificate verification system using blockchain, AI, and decentralized storage that prevents forgery, tampering, and ensures transparency and trust for students, institutions, and employers.

## Key Features (Planned)
- Blockchain-based immutable storage of certificates.
- AI-driven detection of fake or forged certificates.
- Decentralized storage with IPFS.
- Automated and easy verification process.
- Support for both digital and physical certificates.

## Project Status
The ideation phase of this project is complete. The concept, system design, and technology stack have been carefully planned and outlined, but actual development and implementation work has not yet started.

- Submission of certificates as PDFs or scanned physical documents.
- Certificate metadata and IPFS hashes recorded on a permissioned Ethereum blockchain.
- AI model validates certificate authenticity.
- Verification results accessible to stakeholders.
- Permissioned blockchain ensures compliance and cost-effectiveness.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- AI/ML: PyTorch convolutional neural network
- Blockchain: Ethereum permissioned blockchain network
- Storage: IPFS for decentralized document storage
- Databases: PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- Deployment: AWS cloud

## Feasibility and Compliance
- Technically feasible with existing AI, OCR, and blockchain frameworks.
- Designed for smooth integration with institutional workflows.
- Financially efficient via permissioned blockchain and local infrastructure.
- Plans to comply fully with data privacy regulations.

## Next Steps
- Build and test a functional prototype with core features.
- Integrate AI model for certificate forgery detection.
- Develop smart contracts and deploy on a permissioned Ethereum blockchain.
- Implement IPFS-based document storage and retrieval mechanisms.
- Conduct pilot testing with partner institutions for real-world feedback.
- Refine system based on user feedback and performance metrics.
- Prepare for scaled deployment and regulatory approvals.

## Future Scope
- Expand from pilot deployments to state and national rollouts.
- Enhance AI efficiency and accuracy with advanced OCR and computer vision.
- Introduce economic models such as subscriptions or pay-per-verification.
- Extend verification to other government-issued documents beyond academia.
